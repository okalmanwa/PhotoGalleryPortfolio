# INFO 2300 - Project 3

## Project Description

This project involves the development of a responsive, server-side rendered gallery application with functionalities tailored for both consumers and administrators.

### Key Features:

- **Responsive Design**: Developed to provide a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Photo Uploads**: Users can upload photos along with detailed information through a user-friendly form. The form interacts with a MySQL database, updating it with the new entries and automatically refreshing the homepage to include the new photos in the gallery.
- **Admin Operations**: Administrators have access to comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing the gallery images. This includes real-time addition, renaming, and updating of photos via a dedicated admin form.
- **Secure Editing**: Only logged-in administrators can edit photo contents, ensuring the integrity and security of the data.

## Development Server

To run the development server, follow these steps:

1. Open this repository as a Codespace on GitHub (or as a container in VS Code).
2. From the **Run** menu, select **Start Debugging**.
3. Visit <http://127.0.0.1:8080/> in a browser to access the development server.
